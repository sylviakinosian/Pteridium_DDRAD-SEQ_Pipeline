## Pteridium GBS Pipeline

This repository is a collection of scripts for a pipeline for processing Illumina data and analysis using the population genomics program ENTROPY.

Please refer to the **Pteridium\_GBS\_Tutorial.html** document for pipeline usage. 

The [scripts](https://github.com/sylviakinosian/Pteridium_GBS_Pipeline/tree/master/scripts) folder contains all the scripts needed for the pipeline, as well as a few additional scripts a user might find helpful. Please look at each script, read the notes and usage before implementing.

The [entropy](https://github.com/sylviakinosian/Pteridium_GBS_Pipeline/tree/master/entropy) folder contains the source code for the programs Entropy and Estpost, written by [Zach Gompert](https://gompertlab.wordpress.com/). The file **install.txt** has installation instructions for both programs. 

Feel free to make an Issue (above) for any problems/bug found. Additional questions can be directed to: sylvia.kinosian@gmail.com.
